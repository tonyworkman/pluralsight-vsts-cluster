  Use this script to prepare Azure for cluster management via VSTS.
  Please note that only Name parameter is required, the other three are not in use
  however they appear in the course video so you don't forget to get those parameters ready.

  You can always automate cluster deployment even further by adding this preparation bit into VSTS
  so that you don't have to run anything locally.
